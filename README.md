# yaTimeTracker
Yet Another time tracking application or small organizations. It is being developed using MEAN stack i.e. MongoDb, ExpressJs, AngularJs and NodeJs.

Work in Progress. Hoping to finish it soon but everything depends on how much time I can find after my day job to work on it.


Here is a small trello board I created for this app: https://trello.com/b/AjhwYTX8/yatimetracker
